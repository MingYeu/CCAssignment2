                         <p>Plastic arts are art forms which involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by molding or 
                            modeling such as sculpture or ceramics. Less often the term may be used broadly for all the visual 
                            arts (such as painting, sculpture, film and photography), as opposed to literature and music. 
                            Materials for use in the plastic arts, in the narrower definition, include those that can be 
                            carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete, glass, or metal. 


                             </p>
                             <p>The term "plastic" has been used to mean certain synthetic organic resins ever since they were 
                                invented, but the term "plastic arts" long preceded them. The term should not be confused, either, 
                                with Piet Mondrian's concept of "Neoplasticism". </p>

                         <p>The visual arts are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, 
                            photography, video, filmmaking, design, crafts, and architecture. Many artistic disciplines such as 
                            performing arts, conceptual art, and textile arts also involve aspects of visual arts as well as arts 
                            of other types. Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial 
                            design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and decorative art.</p>

                       <p>Current usage of the term "visual arts" includes fine art as well as the applied or decorative arts 
                            and crafts, but this was not always the case. Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and 
                            elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' had for some centuries often been 
                            restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and 
                            not the decorative arts, craft, or applied Visual arts media.</p>

                         <p>A category of fine art, graphic art covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically 
                            two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface. The term usually refers to the arts that rely 
                            more on line or tone than on colour, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it 
                            is sometimes understood to refer specifically to printmaking processes, such as line engraving, 
                            aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, 
                            serigraphy).

                             <p>Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, 
                                computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and 
                                architectural designs.  </p>
